This BA (Hons) programme is designed to meet the current and projected needs of Ireland’s growing entertainment and media industry by equipping graduates with the requisite skills and knowledge demanded by employers in the fields of animation and video game design. However, the programme does not exclusively focus on games development, with modules looking to enhance skills in the fields of sound engineering, photography, and filmography. Overall, this programme offers a well-rounded, focused educational experience which will open a wide array of employment opportunities to successful graduates. All learners are introduced to key foundational technical skills in stage one (Introduction to Programming, 2D Art, Design and Animation, etc.), to basic skills required for critical evaluation (Research Methods) and are encouraged, at a very simplistic level, to find their creative voice (Visual Media). These elementary skills are subsequently expanded and developed at stage two of the BA (Hons). By the end of stage three, learners on the BA (Hons) have the technical skills necessary to articulate their artistic vision, but also the analytical acumen both to anticipate and surmount problems that may arise in developing an artefact; to understand how their project ties in with the state of the art and the possible implications that it may have for both individuals and the wider society as a whole.

Apprenticeship - The apprenticeship Council of Ireland was launched by the Minister for Education and Skills in November 2014 and it is responsible for promoting the development and expansion of apprenticeship programmes in Ireland under the banner of Generation Apprenticeship.

Best Bits of Apprenticeships 
1.	Apprenticeships have traditionally formed part of the education systems in other European countries, particularly Germany where learning acquired in the workplace is recognised and valued. International recognition of the value of combining workplace learning with academic learning is growing and is evidenced by the increase in apprenticeship programmes available. Apprenticeships are affordable for the individual learner as they are earning while they are learning and in most cases, the tuition is funded under a government scheme.
2.	Earn while you learn Apprentices earn while they learn and build valuable work-ready skills in a chosen occupation allowing them to fit studying around their finances. Apprenticeships facilitate exciting and rewarding careers, with learning grounded in the practical experience of undertaking a real job. On successful completion of the apprenticeship programme most graduates are retained by their employer.
3.	Work alongside industry experts You have a workplace mentor who is an industry expert to guide you through the workplace learning experience, plus access to subject matter experts in the classroom. When you qualify, you have all the necessary real-world experience.
4.	Fully-funded tuition Your tuition is funded through the National Training Fund (NTF). The NTF was established by the National Training Fund Act 2000, and is resourced by a levy on employers. Its aims are to raise the skill level of those in employment, to give job seekers skills relevant for meeting the demands of the labour market, and to facilitate lifelong learning. It further aims to provide information in relation to the current and future skills needs of the economy
